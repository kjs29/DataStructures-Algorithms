Here is the question I tried to solve

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1

```
1 2 3 4 5

5 4 3 2 1

-----------
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

Example 2

```
1 2

2 1

------------
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

Example 3

```



-------------
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:

        """
        1 2 3 4 5

        5 4 3 2 1


        curr next list
        1 2 [2,1,3,4,5]
        2 1 []
        """
        curr = head
        if curr is None:
            return
        while curr:
            next = curr.next

            # Move 'next' before curr
            next.next = curr
            
            if next.next is not None:
                curr.next = next.next
            else:
                curr.next = None

            # change curr and next
            curr = curr.next
```
