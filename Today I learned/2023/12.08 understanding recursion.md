Let's consider the following example.

```
Create a function that generates all possible combinations of [1,2,3]

The answer should be:

[
    [1, 2, 3], 
    [1, 2], 
    [1, 3], 
    [1], 
    [2, 3], 
    [2], 
    [3], 
    []
]
```

# ChatGPT's answer: 

Coming up with a recursive solution like this, especially for problems involving combinations, can be challenging if you're not familiar with the recursive thought process. 

Let's break down how you might approach this problem and come up with such a solution:

Understand the Problem:

## The first step is to clearly understand what you're trying to achieve. 

In this case, you want to generate all possible combinations of elements from a given list. This means considering every possible scenario where each item is either included or excluded.

## Think Recursively:

Recursion involves breaking down a problem into smaller instances of the same problem. For combinations, at each step, you have two choices for each element: include it in the current combination or exclude it.

## Visualize with a Smaller Example:

Start with a simple example, like a list with only two elements [1, 2]. How would you list all combinations? They are [], [1], [2], [1, 2]. Notice the pattern? For each number, you choose to include it or not.

## Write Down the Steps:
For each element in the array, write down the steps you would take:

Include the first element, and then find all combinations of the remaining elements.
Exclude the first element, and then find all combinations of the remaining elements.

## Translate to Code:
Translate the above logic into a recursive function. The base case is when you've considered all elements. In each recursive call, you either include the current element in the combination or you don't, and then you proceed to the next element.

## Debugging and Tracing:
Write out a trace of the function calls, as you did, to understand how the function behaves. This is crucial for debugging and ensuring your function covers all cases.

## Practice and Study:
Practice Recursive Problems: The more you work on recursive problems, the more intuitive this kind of thinking becomes.

Study Solutions: Look at existing recursive solutions to similar problems and understand how they work.

Understand Recursion Theory: Learning about how recursion works, its base cases, and how recursive calls stack up can be very helpful.

## Seek Help When Stuck:

Don't hesitate to seek help from more experienced programmers, online forums, or educational resources. Sometimes, an outside perspective can provide the insight needed to solve a problem.

Remember, recursive thinking often requires a different approach than iterative thinking, and it can take some time to get used to. With practice and study, you can improve your ability to come up with such solutions on your own.
