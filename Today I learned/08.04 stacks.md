# What is a stack?

A stack is a linear data structure where insertions and deletions are allowed only at the end, called the top of the stack.

Examples

- Stacks of gym weights

- Stacks of books

- Stacks of coins

Any object can be accessed ONLY from the top.

Any object can be added ONLY at the top.

# Last in, first out (LIFO)

The last element to be pushed in, is the first to be popped out.

# Primary operation

`push()` : Add the element to the stack.

`pop()` : Delete the last inserted element.

`peek()`: returns the last inserted element without removing it.

`size()`: returns size

`isEmpty()` : returns True if the stack is empty, otherwise False.

`isFull()` : returns True if the stack is full, otherwise False.

# Stack implementation

The last element to be pushed in, refers to the head node of linked list, 

and the very bottom element to be pushed in refers to the tail node.

# Stack Overflow

Stack overflow takes place when we push a new element in a full stack.

Stack underflow happens when we pop an element out of an empty stack.
