# Time Complexity

I was struggling to determine the time complexity.

What is the time complexity of the code snippet below?

```js
for (let i=1; i < n; i*=2) {
    // statement
}
```

The answer is `O(log(n))`.

I wanted to see why it is `O(log(n))` myself.

I know that the time complexity is a growth rate of steps(in this case, `i`) with respect to increase in input(in this case, `n`).

So I need to figure out different numbers of steps based on different n.

Just like this...

```
When n is 1, there is 0 step,

When n is 2, there is 1 step,

When n is 3, there are 2 steps, 

When n is 4, there are 2 steps, 

When n is 5, there are 3 steps, and so on.
```

Steps represent the number of calculations.

If you have hard time understanding this, go to [here](https://github.com/kjs29/DataStructures-Algorithms/blob/master/Today%20I%20learned/05.13%20definition%2C%20time%20complexity.md)

As n grows, we are measuring how fast steps increase.

I thought that it would be good to create a hasmap like dictionary and visualize it.

I tried to create a function that calculates the time complexity.

First I had to create a function that replicates the for loop with `i` incrementing by `i = i*2`.

```js
function simple(n) {
    for (let i=1; i<n;i*=2) {
        console.log(1);
    }
}
```

When I invoked the function with argument 5,

```js
simple(5)
```

```
1
1
1
```

There are 3 steps shown.

Next, I created a function that calculates the time complexity of this function.

Because I had to see different number of steps with different number of n,

I created a for loop that iterates from 0 to n, and invoke `simple()` each iteration.

```js
function timeComplexityOfSimple(n) {
    for (let i=0; i<n; i++) {
        console.log(`start ${i}`)
        simple(i)
        console.log(`end ${i}`)
    }
}
```

```js
timeComplexityOfSimple(5)
```

```
start 0
end 0
start 1
end 1
start 2
1
end 2
start 3
1
1
end 3
start 4
1
1
end 4
```

So this output means that 

```
when n is 0, step is 0,

when n is 1, step is 0,

when n is 2, step is 1,

when n is 3, step is 2,

when n is 4, step is 2
```

I thought that instead of `simple()` printing out 1 individually,

I figured I can print out actual number of steps.

So the desired output would be 

```
start 0
0
end 0
start 1
0
end 1
start 2
1
end 2
start 3
2
end 3
start 4
2
end 4
```

So I modified the `simple()`.

```js
function simple(n) {
    let counter = 0;
    for (let i=1; i< n; i*=2) {
        counter++;
    }
    return counter;
}
```

When I ran the code below,

```js
function timeComplexityOfSimple(n) {
    for (let i=0; i<n; i++) {
        console.log(`start ${i}`);
        console.log(simple(i));
        console.log(`end ${i}`);
    }
}

function simple(n) {
    let counter = 0;
    for (let i=1; i< n; i*=2) {
        counter++;
    }
    return counter;
}

timeComplexityOfSimple(5)
```

I got the desired output

```
start 0
0
end 0
start 1
0
end 1
start 2
1
end 2
start 3
2
end 3
start 4
2
end 4
```

But, I realized I could further store the input as key, and step as value in an object.

```js
function timeComplexityOfSimple(n) {
    let empty = {};
    for (let i=0; i<n; i++) {
        empty[i] = simple(i);
    }
    return empty;
}
```

Now then this function now shows an object where key represents `n`, and value represents the corresponding `steps`.

```js
function timeComplexityOfSimple(n) {
  let empty = {};
  for (let i=0; i<n; i++) {
      empty[i] = simple(i);
  }
  return empty;
}

function simple(n) {
  let counter = 0;
  for (let i=1; i< n; i*=2) {
      counter++;
  }
  return counter;
}

console.log(timeComplexityOfSimple(5));
```

```
{ '0': 0, '1': 0, '2': 1, '3': 2, '4': 2 }
```

```
(0,0)
(1,0)
(2,1)
(3,2)
(4,2)
```

Since time complexity measures how fast steps increase as input(n) increases,

we could plot these points to a function and see what the function looks like.

I found out that `chart.js` can draw chart if I gave data points.

All I had to do was to go [here](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/), 

it had a pretty nice walkthrough tutorial.

  return counter;
}

function higherOrder(n) {
  let empty = {};
  for (let i =0 ; i< n; i++) {
    empty[i] = simple(i)
  }
  return empty;
}

let timeComplexitySimple100 = higherOrder(1000);
let keys = Object.keys(timeComplexitySimple100);
let values = Object.values(timeComplexitySimple100);

const ctx = document.getElementById('myChart');
      
new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'line',
    data: {
        labels: keys,
        datasets: [{
        label: 'time complexity',
        data: values,
        borderWidth: 1
        }]
    },
    options: {
        scales: {
        y: {
            beginAtZero: true
        }
        }
    }
});
```

And I can see the chart on a browser.

This chart looks like logarithmic equation so time complexity is `O(log(n))`.

            beginAtZero: true
        }
        }
    }
});
