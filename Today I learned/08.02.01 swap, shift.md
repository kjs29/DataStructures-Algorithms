Swapping elements and shifting elements are important for **sorting algorithms**.

Swap

```py
nums = [1,3,5,7,9]

# swap 1 and 3, using unpacking
nums[0],nums[1] = nums[1],nums[0]
```

```py
nums = [1,3,5,7,9]

# swap 1 and 3, using temporary variable
tmp = nums[0]
nums[0] = nums[1]
nums[1] = tmp
```

Shift

```py
nums = [1,3,5,7,9]

# shift to the right by 1
# it should be [_,1,3,5,7]

for i in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):
    nums[i+1] = nums[i]

# or

# for i in range(len(nums)-1,0,-1):
#     nums[i] = nums[i-1]
```

```py
nums = [1,3,5,7,9]

# shift to the right by 2
# it should be [_,_,1,3,5]

for i in range(len(nums)-3,-1,-1):
    nums[i+2] = nums[i]
```

```py
nums = [1,3,5,7,9]

# shift to the left by 1
# it should be [3,5,7,9,_]

for i in range(len(nums)-1):
    nums[i] = nums[i+1]

# or

# for i in range(1,len(nums)):
#     nums[i-1] = nums[i]
```

```py
nums = [1,3,5,7,9]

# shift to the left by 2
# it should be [5,7,9,_,_]

for i in range(2,len(nums)):
    nums[i-2] = nums[i]
```

# conclusion:

There are multiple ways to implement shifting elements, 

What is really important is what numbers we need to implement shifting.

For example,

```py
nums = [1,3,5,7,9]
```

if we want to shift to the right by 1,

we need 

```
4 3
3 2
2 1
1 0
```

so we can use `range()` to come up with those numbers

```py
for i in range(len(nums)-1,0,-1):
    print(i, i-1)
```

```py
for i in range(len(nums)-2,-1,-1):
    print(i+1, i)
```

They both will print

```
4 3
3 2
2 1
1 0
```
