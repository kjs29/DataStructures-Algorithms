# Data Structures

4 key functionalities of data structures

- Accessing element

- Searching for an element

- Inserting an element

- Deleting an element

# Array 

- Accessing an element: O(1) - Good!

- Searching for an element:

    - Linear Search: O(n)

- Inserting an element:

    - Inserting at the end: O(1)

    - anywhere else: O(n)

- Deleting an element: 

    - Deleting at the end: O(1)

    - anywhere else: O(n)

# LinkedList (Singly)

- Accessing: 
    
    - head: O(1)

    - other nodes: O(n) because it needs to traverse the list, which takes O(n)

- Searching for a node:

    - Linear Search: O(n)

- Inserting an element (Inserting itself is O(1)):

    - Inserting at the front: O(1)

    - anywhere else: O(n) because it needs to traverse the list, which takes O(n)

- Deleting an element (Deleting itself is O(1)):

    - Deleting at the front: O(1)

    - anywhere else: O(n) because it needs to traverse the list, which takes O(n)
