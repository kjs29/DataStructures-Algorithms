# What is Time Complexity?

Time Complexity gives us an estimate of the worst-case scenario in terms of how the runtime grows with the size of the input.

In other words, time complexity is a rate of change in steps(i) with respect to change in the number of inputs(n).

Or we can say it is a growth rate of steps(i) with respect to change in input(n).

Time complexity measures the rate of how fast steps increases as input(N) increases.

# How do we calculate the time Complexity?

```js
for (let i=0; i<n; i++) {
    console.log('hello world!');
}
```

We know that for loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`, `n` times.

That means that when `n` is 1, there will be 1 step (because there are one case for `i`, `i`=0).

Steps can be interpreted like the number of calculations.

Think of steps as y, and input as x.

| input(n) | steps(i) |
|---|---|
|1|1|
|2|2|
|3|3|
|4|4|

From these points, let's discover the formula.

`f(x) = x`

y is growing linearly, as x increases.

Y axis represents the `steps`, X axis represents the `input(n)`.

Replace x with n and erase all the coefficient of x(in this case, it is 1, so we don't need to).

We can say that time complexity is `O(n)`.

# Here is another example.

```js
for (let i=0; i<n; i++) {
    for (let j=0; j<n; j++) {
        console.log('hello world!');
    }
}
```

| input(n) | steps(j) |
|---|---|
|1|1|
|2|4|
|3|9|
|4|16|

Notice that the steps are represented in `j`, not `i` this time.

We have 4 coordinates,

```
(1,1), (2,4), (3,9), (4,16)
```

From the four coordinates, we can derive this formula.

```
f(x) = x^2
```

Replace x with n.

The time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

# Here is another example.

```js
function findFirst(arr) {
    let first = arr[0];
    return first;
}
```

As data gets bigger, time complexity shows how longer the program(or algorithm) takes.

The time complexity of the example above is actually `O(1)` because no matter how larger `arr` gets, it will always calculate one time, so `O(1)`.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    // statement
}
```

This example is simple.

This will calculate 4 times. That's it. Any contant becomes 1 in Big-O notation, so it will be `O(1)`.

# Let's look at this example.

```js
function arrayMax(arr) {
    let currentMax = arr[0];        

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (currentMax < arr[i]) {      
            currentMax = arr[i];        
        }
    }

    return currentMax;
}
```

We can see that inside `for` loop, we see `if` clause.

```js
if (currentMax < arr[i]) {      
    currentMax = arr[i];        
}
```

For the sake of simplicity, we can assume that `currentMax < arr[i]` does 1 calculation,

and if the condition is true, `currentMax = arr[i]` does 1 calculation as well.

In the worst case scenario, the condition is always true every single iteration.

```js
if (currentMax < arr[i]) {      
    currentMax = arr[i];        
}
```

We assume the worst case so every iteration it performs 2 calculations.

Now let's take a look at how many times `for loop` iterates over.

```js
for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {

}
```

Since we don't know `arr.length`, let's assume that `arr.length` is `n`.

| input(n) | steps(i) |
|---|---|
|2|1|
|3|2|
|4|3|
|5|4|

We know that we can derive this equation from these coordinates.

```
f(x) = x - 1
```

There are `x-1` iterations. And 2 calculations take place in every iteration.

After replacing x with n, that is `2  * (n - 1)` calculations.

And we add 1 because `let currentMax = arr[0];` does 1 calculation.

```js
function arrayMax(arr) {
    let currentMax = arr[0];                    // 1

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {      // (n - 1) 

        if (currentMax < arr[i]) {              // 1
            currentMax = arr[i];                // 1
        }
    }

    return currentMax;
}
```

Total calculations

```
1 + 2 * (n - 1) = 2n - 1
```

Because we ignore constants, the time complexity is `O(n)`.

```js
function arrayMax(arr) {
    let currentMax = arr[0];                    // 1

    for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {      // (n - 1) 

        if (currentMax < arr[i]) {              // 1
            currentMax = arr[i];                // 1
        }
    }

    return currentMax;
}
```

Simple way to calculate is this.

We do not need to worry about the code below, 

because when we assume the worst, `(currentMax < arr[i])` is always true and `currentMax = arr[i]` will always execute.

```js
if (currentMax < arr[i]) {
    currentMax = arr[i]
}
```

also, we don't need to worry about constants like `let currentMax = arr[0];`.

The code below is all we need to worry about to figure out the time complexity.

```js
for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // statement
}
```

Time complexity is `O(n)`.

# Here is another example.

```js
for (let i = 1; i < n; i*=2) {
    // statement
}
```

| input(n) | steps(i) |
|---|---|
|1|0|
|2|1|
|3|2|
|4|2|
|5|2|
|6|3|
|7|3|
|8|3|
|9|4|

Even if we know that input(n) is x, and steps(i) is y,

it is hard to find out what types of equation this is.

| iteration(k) | value of i | condition (true or false) | Statement |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2^0 = 1 | (1 < n) is true | statement is executed |
| 2 | 2^1 = 2 | (2 < n) is true | statement is executed |
| 3 | 2^2 = 4 | (4 < n) is true | statement is executed |
| 4 | 2^3 = 8 | (8 < n) is true | statement is executed |
| 5 | 2^4 = 16 | (16 < n) is true | statement is executed |
|  | ... | ... | ... |
| k | 2^(k-1) | (2^(k-1) < n) is true | statement is executed |
| k+1 | 2^k | (2^k < n) is false | statement is not executed |

In each iteration, the value of `i` grows

2^0 = 1

2^0 * 2 = 2

2^1 * 2 = 4

2^2 * 2 = 8

2^3 * 2 = 16

`k` represents the number of iterations a loop performs.

Now we have to find out what the value of `i` will be based on k times of iteration. Because we are interested in if `i` value will be true or false on k times of iteration.

Now let's find a formula.

When k = 1, 

`i = 2^0 = 2^(k-1) = 1`

When k = 2, 

`i = 2^1 = 2^(k-1) = 2`

When k = 3, 

`i = 2^2 = 2^(k-1) = 4`

When k = 4, 

`i = 2^3 = 2^(k-1) = 8`

That means that for k times of iteration, the `i` value will be `2^(k-1)`

When `(i < n)` is false, the for loop stops. So we can say that when `(i == n)`, it also stops.

Since the `i` value is `2^(k-1)`,

`2^(k-1) = n`

`k - 1 = log2(n)`

`k = log2(n) + 1`. We also care about the highest order term, so it is just `log(n)`.

So the answer is `O(log(n))`
