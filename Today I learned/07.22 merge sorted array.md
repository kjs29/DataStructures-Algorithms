[Question 88. Merge Sorted Array - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)


Question

We are given two non-descending arrays

```py
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0]
nums2 = [2,5,6]

m = 3 # unique number of elements in nums1
n = 3 # length of nums2
```

Create a function that merge two arrays into `nums1`.

`nums1` should look like `[1,2,2,3,5,6]`

---

My first approach

```
Create variable that tracks the index of nums2, set to 0 initially
(nums2_index = 0)

Iterate through nums1 starting from m-1 index to 0,

if nums1[i] > nums2[nums2_index]:
    
```

And I got stuck, so I went to see other people's approach.

I saw other people's answers on Leetcode solutions,

but I couldn't still understand from reading the codes. (Even though I think that is important to understand from looking at the code only)

So I went to Neetcode solution [video](https://youtu.be/P1Ic85RarKY).

The Neetcode approach

```
Create variables that track nums1 and nums2's index.

    nums1_index = m - 1

    nums2_index = n - 1

Iterate through the nums1 from the last index,

    if nums1[nums1_index] is bigger than nums2[nums2_index],
        
        overwrite nums1[nums1_index] to nums1[i]
        decrement nums1_index by 1        
    
    else:
        overwrite nums2[nums2_index] to nums1[i]
        decrement nums2_index by 1

    if nums2_index becomes -1, break out of the loop

# edge case
If nums2_index >= 0,
    for i in range(nums2_index,-1,-1):
        nums1[i] = nums2[nums2_index]
```

The neetcode solution used while loop, but I feel more comfortable with for loop

Here is the solution

```py
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        
        nums1_index = m - 1
        nums2_index = n - 1

        for i in range(m+n-1, -1,-1):
            if nums2_index <= -1:
                break

            if nums1[nums1_index] > nums2[nums2_index]:
                nums1[i] = nums1[nums1_index]
                nums1_index -= 1
            
            else:
                nums1[i] = nums2[nums2_index]
                nums2_index -= 1

        if nums2_index >= 0:
            for i in range(nums2_index,-1,-1):
                nums1[i] = nums2[i]

```
