# Merge sort algorithm

MergeSort uses divide (recursive) and conquer algorithm

And it combines them at the end.

## 1. Divide

Break the problem into sub-problems

## 2. Conquer

Solve the sub-problem

## 3. Combine

Combine the solved sub-problems together

Let's take a look at the following code.

```py
def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    # divide
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_arr = arr[:mid]
    right_arr = arr[mid:]

    left_arr = mergeSort(left_arr)
    right_arr = mergeSort(right_arr)

    # conquer & combine
    return merge(left_arr, right_arr)

def merge(left_arr, right_arr):
    i = 0
    j = 0
    k = 0
    new_arr = [0] * (len(left_arr) + len(right_arr))

    while i < len(left_arr) and j < len(right_arr):
        if left_arr[i] < right_arr[j]:
            new_arr[k] = left_arr[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            new_arr[k] = right_arr[j]
            j += 1
        k += 1
    
    while i < len(left_arr):
        new_arr[k] = left_arr[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1

    while j < len(right_arr):
        new_arr[k] = right_arr[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1

    return new_arr
```

# Pros and cons of mergeSort.

## Pros

- Large size list

- Linked list

- External merging is possible

(if we have 2GB, 5GB sized hard disks, we don't need 7GB, we need smaller sized storage to merge externally, and copy them to a big sized hard disk)

- Stable

(previous arrangements are not disturbed)

## Cons

- Requires extra space for arrays , not for linked lists

(Not an inplace sort) But I heard that there is an in-place merge sort. I will look into it more.

- For smaller sized problems, it is slower than other algorithms.
