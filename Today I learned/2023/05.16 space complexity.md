# Space complexity

Space complexity is the rate of how much of memory is used with respect to increase in `n`.

Space complexity increases when 

- assigning variables

- creating new data structures

- function calling and allocation

(source :  Coder.A , Big O Notation(Space Complexity), https://youtu.be/SHIg5UIfBnI)

# Example 

```js
let empty = [];
for (let i=0;i<n;i++) {
    empty.push(i);
}
```

In the example above,

as `n` grows the number of elements in the `empty` grows proportionately.

Therefore, space complexity is `O(n)`.

# Example

```js
let arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
for (let i=0;i<arr.length;i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

In the example above, space complexity doesn't increase 

as `console.log(arr[i])` does not assign any variables or create any data structures.

The array `arr` has been made, but its size is not counted towards the space complexity of the algorithm.

Therefore, space complexity is `O(1)`.
