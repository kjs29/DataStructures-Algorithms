In arrays,

there are 3 different forms of inserting an element.

1. Inserting an element at the end of the array

2. Inserting an element at the beginning of the array

3. Inserting an element at the given index inside the array


# Inserting an element at the end

```py
arr = [0,0,0,0,0]
```

```py
# We want to add 5 at the last index of the array
arr[len(arr)-1] = 5
```

Time complexity is O(1) because we just access the array. Accessing in the array is O(1).

# Inserting at the beginning of the array

```py
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

```py
# We want to add 0 at the beginning of the array
#   1. the result : [0,1,2,3,4]
#   2. move all the element to the right by 1 position
#   3. insert 0 at the beginning of the array

for i in range(len(arr)-1):
    arr[i+1] = arr[i]
```

If we run this code, `arr` will be `[1,1,1,1,1]`.

So it is important that we need to find a way to correctly assign the previous index's element to the next index's element.

```py
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

# result should be [1,1,2,3,4]
```

One possible way to achieve this is iterating through the array from the last element to the first.

```py
for i in range(len(arr)-2, -1, -1):
    print(i)            # 3,2,1,0
    arr[i+1] = arr[i]
```

And then we add `0` to the 0 position of the array.

```py
arr[0] = 0
```

Now array is `[0,1,2,3,4]`

The time complexity is O(n) since we move all the elements in the array by 1 position.

# Inserting an element at a given index of the array

```py
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]

# We want to add 0 at position 3
#   1. the result : [1,2,3,0,4]
#   2. iterate the array from position 3 to the last element
#   3. insert 0 at position 3
```

First, we need to iterate through the array from the last element to the index position we want to insert a new element at.

This is basically the same problem as the `inserting an element from the start of the array` but only difference is we are inserting at a given index this time.

After this iteration, the result should look like

```py
arr = [1,2,3,4,4]
```

The numbers that we need to retrieve from the iteration are

```
4 3
```

Because we need to 

1. access an element at index 3, and assign it to index 4.

We need to retrieve only 3 because index 4 can be `i+1`

We can create a for loop like the following

```py
for i in range(len(arr)-2, 2,-1):
    print(i)        # 3
    arr[i+1] = arr[i]

print(arr)          # [1,2,3,4,4]

arr[3] = 0

print(arr)          # [1,2,3,0,4]
```
