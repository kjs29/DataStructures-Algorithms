# What is a linked list?

A linked-list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored at a contiguous memory location.

(Arrays are stored at a contiguous memory location)

Linked lists have two attributes, data and next.

# linked list is made up of nodes.

In this `Node` class, 

```py
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next = None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next
```

We have a constructor that have data, and next attributes.

data attribute contains its data, and next attribute contains the next node.

We can create nodes like the code below.

```py
nodeA = Node(10)
nodeB = Node(5)
nodeC = Node(7)
```

We just created three nodes, nodeA, nodeB, nodeC.

Now we can connect nodeA to nodeB, and nodeB to nodeC.

```py
nodeA.next = nodeB
nodeB.next = nodeC
```

# Create a countNode method.


```py
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data, next = None):
        self.data = data
        self.next = next

    def countNodes(head):
        count = 1
        if head.next == None:
            return 1
        while head.next != None:
            head = head.next
            count += 1
        return count
    
nodeA = Node(4)
nodeB = Node(2)
nodeC = Node(3)
nodeD = Node(10)
nodeE = Node(2)

nodeA.next = nodeB
nodeB.next = nodeC
nodeC.next = nodeD
nodeD.next = nodeE

print(Node.countNodes(nodeC))       // 3, because C D E
```
