[Question 88. Merge Sorted Array - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)


Question

We are given two non-descending arrays

```py
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0]
nums2 = [2,5,6]

m = 3 # unique number of elements in nums1
n = 3 # length of nums2
```

Create a function that merge two arrays into `nums1`.

`nums1` should look like `[1,2,2,3,5,6]`

---

My first approach

```
Create variable that tracks the index of nums2, set to 0 initially
(nums2_index = 0)

Iterate through nums1 starting 0 to len(nums1) - 1 with i

If nums1[i] is bigger than nums2[nums2_index],
    - move onwards elements(starting from nums1[i+1]...til the end) to the right by 1 position,
    - assign nums2[nums2_index] to nums1[i]
    - increment nums2_index by 1
```

And I got stuck, so I went to see other people's approach.

I saw other people's answers on Leetcode solutions,

but I couldn't still understand from reading the codes. (Even though I think that is important to understand from looking at the code only)

So I went to Neetcode solution [video](https://youtu.be/P1Ic85RarKY).

The Neetcode approach

```
Create variables that track nums1 and nums2's index.

    nums1_index = m - 1

    nums2_index = n - 1

Iterate through the nums1 from the last index,

    if nums1[nums1_index] is bigger than nums2[nums2_index],
        
        overwrite nums1[nums1_index] to nums1[i]
        decrement nums1_index by 1        
    
    else:
        overwrite nums2[nums2_index] to nums1[i]
        decrement nums2_index by 1

    if nums2_index becomes -1, break out of the loop

# edge case
If nums2_index >= 0,
    for i in range(nums2_index,-1,-1):
        nums1[i] = nums2[nums2_index]
```

The neetcode solution used while loop, but I feel more comfortable with for loop

Here is the solution I had a tweak on Neetcode video's solution.

```py
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        
        nums1_index = m - 1
        nums2_index = n - 1

        for i in range(m+n-1, -1,-1):
            if nums2_index <= -1:
                break

            if nums1[nums1_index] > nums2[nums2_index]:
                nums1[i] = nums1[nums1_index]
                nums1_index -= 1
            
            else:
                nums1[i] = nums2[nums2_index]
                nums2_index -= 1

        if nums2_index >= 0:
            for i in range(nums2_index,-1,-1):
                nums1[i] = nums2[i]

```

My Mistakes on the first approach

```
- My first approach

Create variable that tracks the index of nums2, set to 0 initially
(nums2_index = 0)

Iterate through nums1 starting 0 to len(nums1) - 1 with i

If nums1[i] is bigger than nums2[nums2_index],
    - move onwards elements(starting from nums1[i+1]...til the end) to the right by 1 position,
    - assign nums2[nums2_index] to nums1[i]
    - increment nums2_index by 1

--------------------------------------------------------
What I could have done to get better....

- I could have iterated the loop from the end because,
    inserting an element to the start of an array is O(n), but inserting an element to the end is O(1)

- I could have had separate iterators to keep track of nums1's index, and nums2's index
    but what I did was to have only nums2's index

- I could have tried to understand the problem more thoroughly because,
    when I compare the two numbers nums1[i] and nums2[nums2_index],
        the condition
            when nums1[i] > nums2[nums2_index],
            when nums1[i] == nums2[nums2_index]
        should have the same function body
```
