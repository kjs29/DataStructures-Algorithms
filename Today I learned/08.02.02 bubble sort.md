Continuing from [previous til: swap, shift](https://github.com/kjs29/DataStructures-Algorithms/blob/master/Today%20I%20learned/08.02.01%20swap%2C%20shift.md)

Bubble sort iterates through the list, comparing the first and the second element, 

swap if the first element is bigger than the second element.

After the last two elements are compared then start iterating the list from the beginning.

When there is no swap in the entire list, return the list.

```
nums = [2,5,4,3,1]

   first element > second element   |            nums          |   swapped  |
1.          False                   | [2,5,4,3,1]->[2,5,4,3,1] |    False   |
2.          True                    | [2,5,4,3,1]->[2,4,5,3,1] |    True    |
3.          True                    | [2,4,5,3,1]->[2,4,3,5,1] |    True    |
4.          True                    | [2,4,3,5,1]->[2,4,3,1,5] |    True    | -> since swapped is True, iterate from the beginning, swap reset to False

5.          False                   | [2,4,3,1,5]->[2,4,3,1,5] |    False   |
6.          True                    | [2,4,3,1,5]->[2,3,4,1,5] |    True    |
7.          True                    | [2,3,4,1,5]->[2,3,1,4,5] |    True    | -> since swapped is True, iterate from the beginning, swap reset to False

8.          False                   | [2,3,1,4,5]->[2,3,1,4,5] |    False   |
9.          True                    | [2,3,1,4,5]->[2,1,3,4,5] |    True    | -> since swapped is True, iterate from the beginning, swap reset to False

10.         True                    | [2,1,3,4,5]->[1,2,3,4,5] |    True    | -> reached the end of the loop, return nums
```

It is important to figure out what numbers, `i` or`j` , we need.

numbers that we need (index of the numbers that we will check in every single loop)

```
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4

0 1
1 2
2 3

0 1
1 2

0 1
```

We can intuitively figure out that there will be 4 iterations in the outer loop, and 

inside the each inner loop, we will have 4,3,2,1 iterations.

since inner loop's iteration shrink by 1, we can derive it from the fact that each iteration in the outer loop increases.

Bubble sort using for loop.

```py
for i in range(len(nums)-1):
    swapped = False
    for j in range(len(nums)-1-i):
        if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:
            nums[j+1],nums[j]=nums[j],nums[j+1]
            swapped = True
    if not swapped:
        break
```

**Usage:**
Bubble sort is straightforward to understand and implement, 

but it's inefficient for large lists compared to more advanced sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort. 

It is often taught as an introductory sorting algorithm in computer science courses but is rarely used in practice for performance-critical applications.
