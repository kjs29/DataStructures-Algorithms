# dequeue in Python

Deque means double ended queue.

`deque` is imported from `collections` module.

```py
from collections import deque   # import deque from collections module

waitlist = ['J','A']

# Turn the list into a double-ended queue
waitlist = deque(waitlist)    # ['J', 'A']

# Add element to a queue
waitlist.append('S')               # ['J', 'A', 'S']

# Remove the first item from the queue
waitlist.popleft()                 # ['A', 'S']

# Add element to the beginning of the queue
waitlist.appendleft('W')           # ['W', 'A', 'S']

# Move 2 number of positions to the left
waitlist.rotate(-2)                # ['S', 'W', 'A']

# Add multiple elements to the end of the queue
waitlist.extend(['C', 'E'])        # ['S', 'W', 'A', 'C', 'E']

# Add multiple elements to the front of the queue
waitlist.extendleft(['R','D'])     # Notice that 'R' becomes the first element, then 'D' becomes the first element. ['D', 'R', 'S', 'W', 'A', 'C', 'E']
```
