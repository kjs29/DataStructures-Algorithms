When we solve problems, the most important thing and the most difficult thing is to UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM.

```
Problem: 
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and 

choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. 

If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
output: 5
```

```
Problem:
Given an array nums, 

write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

You must minimize the total number of operations.

input: [0,1,0,3,12]
output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```


You have a limited amount of time so you may be tempted to start coding as soon as possible. 

Resist the temptation! 

Take a few minutes, read over the problem to make sure you understand.

- What is the problem asking you to do?

- Can you restate the problem in your own words?

- Do you understand all of the words in the problem?

- Do you have enough information to solve the problem?

- Are there any constraints or edge cases to consider
