If someone asked me to find minimum sum of submatrices `n`x`n` within a given matrix,

I would do this.

```
1. Try to get find out how I can come up with brute-force solution.

2. Think about how I can make brute-force solution better
```

# 1

This will be a brute-force solution.

```py
def min_sum_submatrix(matrix, n):

    M = len(matrix)
    N = len(matrix[0])
    min_submatrix_sum = float('inf')
    for r in range(M-n+1):
        for c in range(N-n+1):
            sub_matrix_sum = 0
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    sub_matrix_sum += matrix[r+i][c+j]
            min_submatrix_sum = min(sub_matrix_sum, min_submatrix_sum)

    return min_submatrix_sum

print(min_sum_submatrix(matrix, 2))
```

Eventually I knew that this brute-force would not work.

I researched how to find the answer. 

The answer lied in dynamic programming.

Dynamic programming is to break down into sub-problems, the results are saved, and then sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution.

Way better explanation of dynamic programming [here](https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-explain-dynamic-programming-to-a-4-year-old/answer/Jonathan-Paulson)

Let's take a look at the example.

```py
matrix = [
    [1,3,2],
    [3,5,1],
    [1,0,0]
]
```

So instead of finding sum of each coordinate's numbers in `matrix`,

we can create a prefix sum matrix like below.

```py
dp = [
    [1,4,6],
    [4,12,15],
    [5,13,16]
]
```

It seems now that `dp` can't do anything, however, it can help us figure out the sum of each submatrix.

Let's say that there is a prefix sum matrix,

```
a b c
d e f
g h i
```

`efhi`'s area = `i` - `g` - `c` + `a`

We need the ending index `i` and starting index `e` to get `efhi`'s area.

Knowing this, we can apply this to find the sum of each sub-matrices sized `n`.

Going back to our original example,

```py
matrix = [
    [1,3,2],
    [3,5,1],
    [1,0,0]
]
```

To find the `2` x `2` submatrices, we have 4 possible submatrices.

```
[1,3,3,5]
[3,2,5,1]
[3,5,1,0]
[5,1,0,0]
```

When we take a look at these submatrices, we can see that the ending index of each submatrix is 

```
(1,1)
(1,2)
(2,1)
(2,2)
```

If we get `3` x `3` submatrix example, it would be just one,

```
[1,3,2,3,5,1,1,0,0]
```

and its ending index is

```
(2,2)
```

We can see that there is a pattern in ending index of submatrices.

Once we can create for loops that generate ending index of submatrices, we will be able to get the area of each submatrix.

```py
"""
1 2 3 3 3
1 1 1 3 2
0 0 1 2 2
1 2 3 3 3
1 1 1 3 2
"""
# submatrix size
n = 2

# matrix size M is # of rows, N is # of cols
M = 5
N = 5

for r in range(n, M+1):
    for c in range(n, N+1):
        
        # ending point
        endingpoint = (r-1, c-1)

        # starting point
        startingpoint = (r-1-(n-1), c-1-(n-1))
```

But since we have one more row and col filled with zeros,

we can add 1 to starting and ending point.

```py
"""
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 2 3 3 3
0 1 1 1 3 2
0 0 0 1 2 2
0 1 2 3 3 3
0 1 1 1 3 2
"""

# submatrix size
n = 2

# matrix size M is # of rows, N is # of cols
M = 5
N = 5

for r in range(n, M+1):
    for c in range(n, N+1):
        
        # ending point
        endingpoint = (r, c)

        # starting point
        startingpoint = (r-1-(n-1)+1, c-1-(n-1)+1)
```

We figured out starting and ending point for every submatrix `n` x `n`.

Let's get area for each submatrix.

```py
for r in range(n, M+1):
    for c in range(n, N+1):
        
        # ending point
        endingpoint = (r, c)
        r2 = endingpoint[0]
        c2 = endingpoint[1]

        # starting point
        startingpoint = (r-(n-1), c-(n-1))
        r1 = startingpoint[0]
        c1 = startingpoint[1]

        # area for each submatrix
        area = dp[r2][c2] - dp[r2][c1-1] - dp[r1-1][c2] + dp[r1-1][c1-1]
```

we can now create a new variable that stores the minimum sum of submatrices.

```py
min_sum = float('inf')

for r in range(n, M+1):
    for c in range(n, N+1):
        
        # ending point
        endingpoint = (r, c)
        r2 = endingpoint[0]
        c2 = endingpoint[1]

        # starting point
        startingpoint = (r-(n-1), c-(n-1))
        r1 = startingpoint[0]
        c1 = startingpoint[1]

        # area for each submatrix
        area = dp[r2][c2] - dp[r2][c1-1] - dp[r1-1][c2] + dp[r1-1][c1-1]

        min_sum = min(area, min_sum)
```

And then, we can handle edge cases such as when n is less than 0, or bigger than the size of M or N.

If we put altogether, it can look like the following.

```py
def min_sum_submatrix(matrix,n):
    """
    Find the minimum n x n submatrices within the given matrix
    """

    M = len(matrix)
    N = len(matrix[0])
    
    # create a template for the prefix sum matrix, 
    # initializing a (M+1) x (N+1) matrix with zeros
    template = [[0 for _ in range(N+1)] for _ in range(M+1)]
    
    for r in range(M):
        for c in range(N):
            template[r+1][c+1] = template[r][c+1] + template[r+1][c] - template[r][c] + matrix[r][c]
    

    # iterate through the submatrices and find the minimum sum
    min_submatrix_sum = float('inf')

    for r in range(n, M+1):
        for c in range(n, N+1):
            
            # calculate the starting row and column for the current submatrix
            r1 = r - (n - 1)
            c1 = c - (n - 1)
            
            # calculate the sum of the current submatrix n x n
            current_submatrix_sum = template[r][c] - template[r1-1][c] - template[r][c1-1] + template[r1-1][c1-1]
            
            # updating min_submatrix_sum
            min_submatrix_sum = min(min_submatrix_sum,current_submatrix_sum)
    
    if min_submatrix_sum == float('inf'):
        return None
    
    return min_submatrix_sum
```
