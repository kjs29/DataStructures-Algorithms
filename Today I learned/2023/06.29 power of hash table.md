# Let's learn why using hash table gives us benefits

Question:

We have two arrays, create a function that takes arr1 and arr2, and returns true if arr2 is a subset of arr1, otherwise false.

```py
arr1= [11, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7]
arr2=[11, 3, 7, 1]

def subArr(arr1, arr2):
    for el in arr2:
        if el not in arr1:
            return False
    return True

print(subArr(arr1, arr2))
```

I would make it like this, but time complexity would be O(A*B) where A,B means length of arr2, and arr1 respectively.

Because for loop takes n operations, and `if ... in` takes n operations. 

However, if we use hashtable, we can reduce time complexity in exchange of space complexity.

```py
arr1= [11, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7]
arr2=[11, 3, 7, 1]

def subArr(arr1, arr2):

    hashmap = set(arr1)
    for k in arr2:
        if k not in hashmap:
            return False
    return True

print(subArr(arr1, arr2))
```

Assume that len(arr1) is n, and len(arr2) is m.

Creating a a set `hashmap` takes O(n) operations, 

iterating through arr2 takes O(m) operations.

But look up in a hashmap takes O(1) operation

Therefore the time complexity for this function is O(n+m).

For the space complexity, creating a `hashmap` takes O(n) memory.

# Conclusion

If possible, use hashmap look up, because it takes O(1) runtime.

But iterating through hashmap still takes O(n) runtime.
