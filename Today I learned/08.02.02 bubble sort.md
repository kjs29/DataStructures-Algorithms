Continuing from [previous til: swap, shift]()

Bubble sort compares two elements adjacent to each other,

if the first element is bigger than the second element, swap two.

```
nums = [2,5,4,3,1]

   first element > second element   |            nums          |   swapped  |
1.          False                   | [2,5,4,3,1]->[2,5,4,3,1] |    False   |
2.          True                    | [2,5,4,3,1]->[2,4,5,3,1] |    True    |
3.          True                    | [2,4,5,3,1]->[2,4,3,5,1] |    True    |
4.          True                    | [2,4,3,5,1]->[2,4,3,1,5] |    True    | -> since swapped is True, iterate from the beginning, swap reset to False

5.          False                   | [2,4,3,1,5]->[2,4,3,1,5] |    False   |
6.          True                    | [2,4,3,1,5]->[2,3,4,1,5] |    True    |
7.          True                    | [2,3,4,1,5]->[2,3,1,4,5] |    True    | -> since swapped is True, iterate from the beginning, swap reset to False

8.          False                   | [2,3,1,4,5]->[2,3,1,4,5] |    False   |
9.          True                    | [2,3,1,4,5]->[2,1,3,4,5] |    True    | -> since swapped is True, iterate from the beginning, swap reset to False

10.         True                    | [2,1,3,4,5]->[1,2,3,4,5] |    True    | -> reached the end of the loop, return nums
```

It is important to figure out what numbers, `i` or`j` , we need.

numbers that we need

```
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4

0 1
1 2
2 3

0 1
1 2

0 1
```

For bubble sort problem, we intuitively know there should be two for loops.

Bubble sort using for loop.

```py
for i in range(len(nums)-1):
    swapped = False
    for j in range(len(nums)-1-i):
        if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:
            nums[j+1],nums[j]=nums[j],nums[j+1]
            swapped = True
    if not swapped:
        break
```
