My first implementation of LinkedList

(verified on [Design Linked List 707. LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/description/))

```py
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
class MyLinkedList:

    def __init__(self, val=None):
        
        if val is not None:
            self.head = Node(val)
            self.size = 1
        else:
            self.head = Node(val)
            self.size = 0

    def get(self, index: int) -> int:
        
        curr = self.head
        
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return -1
        for _ in range(index):
            curr = curr.next
        return curr.val

    def addAtHead(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.addAtIndex(0, val)

    def addAtTail(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.addAtIndex(self.size, val)

    def addAtIndex(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        if index < 0 or index > self.size:
            return
        
        curr = self.head
        new = Node(val)

        if index == 0:
            # add at head
            new.next = curr
            self.head = new
        else:
            # add at tail, or anywhere else
            for _ in range(index-1):
                curr = curr.next
            new.next = curr.next
            curr.next = new
        
        self.size += 1

    def deleteAtIndex(self, index: int) -> None:
        
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return
        
        curr = self.head

        if index == 0:
            self.head = curr.next
        else:
            for _ in range(index -1):
                curr = curr.next
            curr.next = curr.next.next
        
        self.size -= 1
```

Five key operations:

## Access:

`get(self, index)`

```
1. If 'index' is not valid, do nothing.

2. Assign self.head to 'curr'

3. Iterate the whole list 'index' times. -> for _ in range(index):

    a. In each iteration, update 'curr' by 'curr = curr.next'
```

## Insert:

Edge case:

1. index is invald

    - `index < 0`

    - `index > self.size`

2. `index == 0`

---

### if index is 0

```
*Add 'A' at the front
B -> C

1. Create a new node with the provided value, 'new'.

2. 'curr' is initialized at the head of the list.

2. Assign 'new.next' to the current head node 'curr'. Now 'new' points to 'curr'.

3. Assign 'self.head' to 'new'. Now 'new' is the new head of the list.

A -> B -> C
```

### if index is any valid number

```
*Add 'Three' at the end
'One' -> 'Two'

1. Create a new node with the provided value, 'new'.

2. 'curr' is initialized at the head of the list. By traversing the list 'self.size-1' times, 'curr' will be updated with 'curr = curr.next', 

or alternatively we can traverse the list until the 'curr.next' is None.

3. Now we are at the last node of the list, assign 'curr.next' to the new node, 'new'.

'One' -> 'Two' -> 'Three'
```

```
*Add '3' at index 2
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5

1. Inserting a node at a specific position requires the node, that is positioned one spot prior to the new node's intended position, to point to the new node.

2. Knowing that, determine what node 'curr' should be. 'curr' is initialized at the head of the list.

By traversing 'index-1' times, 'curr' will be updated by 'curr = curr.next'.

Since we need to insert a new node '3' at index 2, 'curr' should be '2' at index 1, then 'curr.next' will be '4'.

3. With the 'curr' at the right node, create a new node 'new', then assign 'new.next' to 'curr.next'. Now 'new' points to 'curr.next'

4. Assign 'curr.next' to 'new'. 'curr.next = new'. Now 'curr' points to 'new', and 'new' points to 'curr.next'

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

## Delete:

Edge Cases:

1. Index is invalid

    - `index < 0`

    - `index >= self.size`

2. `index == 0`

---

### if index is 0

`deleteAtHead(self)`

```
*Delete '1' at the front
1 -> 2 -> 3

This is edge case.

We want to delete node '1'.

1. Set 'curr' as 'self.head'

2. Assign 'curr.next' to 'self.head'. This will make a 'curr.next' as new 'self.head'
```

### if index is any other valid number

```
*Delete '2'
1 -> 2 -> 3

We want to delete node '2'.

1. Initialize 'curr' as 'self.head', representing the current node.

2. Traverse the list 'index-1' times by repeatedly updating 'curr' to 'curr.next' until we reach the node immediately before the one we want to delete. 

In this case, we want to delete '2' which is at index 1, so we need 'curr' to be at index 0, which is '1'.

3. Once we have reached the correct position, update 'curr.next' to skip over the node we want to delete, 

for example, 'curr.next' becomes 'curr.next.next'. 

This effectively removes '2' from the list by breaking the link from '1' to '2' and instead linking '1' directly to '3'.
```

```
*Delete '3'
1 -> 2 -> 3

We want to delete node '3'.

1. Initialize 'curr' as 'self.head', representing the current node.

2. Traverse the list 'index-1' times by repeatedly updating 'curr' to 'curr.next'.

In this case, '3' is at index 2, so '2' becomes 'curr'.

3. Once 'curr' is at the right node, update 'curr.next' to 'curr.next.next'.

Technically, 'curr.next = curr.next' seems to make sense, in this case. 

However 'curr.next = curr.next.next' applies to any other index, therefore it can be used instead.
```

## Print List

```
*Print all the nodes' val
'A' -> 'B' -> 'C'

We want to print all the nodes until the node's next is None

1. Set 'curr' as 'self.head', representing the current node.

2. Traverse the list 'self.size' times, because that is the length of the list.

    a. In each iteration, print 'curr.val'

    b. Update 'curr' to 'curr.next'

--- Alternative for 2

2. If we don't know the size, traverse the list using while loop until the node's next is None.

while True:
    if curr.next is None:
        break
    print(curr.val, end=" ")
    curr = curr.next

or 

while curr is not None:
    print(curr.val, end=" ")
    curr = curr.next
```
