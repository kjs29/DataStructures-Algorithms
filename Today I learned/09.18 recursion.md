# What is recursion?

Recursion refers to the method where the solution to a problem can be broken down into smaller problems that involves calling the function itself with modified arguments.

Let's consider this sequence.

```
4, 5, 9, 14, 23, 37, â€¦
```

If we were to create a function that takes 5, and returns 23,

it would be like the following.

```py
def sequence(n):
    if n < 0:
        return -1
    
    if n == 1:
        return 4
    elif n == 2:
        return 5

    return sequence(n-2) + sequence(n-1)
```
In recursive functions, we define two essential components:

- Base Case: This is the condition that defines when the recursion should stop, preventing the function from calling itself indefinitely and running forever. In the function above, the base cases are when n equals 1 or 2.

- Recursive Case: This portion of the function is where the recursion occurs, breaking down the problem into smaller instances. It calls the function itself with modified arguments, working progressively towards reaching the base case.

It is imperative that the recursive case gets closer to the base case with each recursive call to avoid infinite recursion. Failing to do so can result in errors such as:

- RecursionError in Python

- StackOverflowError in Java

- RangeError in JavaScript

All these errors occur because each recursive call uses a portion of stack memory, and infinite recursion can exceed the available stack limit, resulting in a **stack overflow**.

# Pros and Cons of Recursion:

Pros:

- Extremely practical for tree traversals and binary search.

Cons:

- Does not scale up like iteration. Requires more memory.

- More abstract or harder to understand than iterative solutions.

# Java code for factorial

```java
public class Recursion {
    
    // iterative way
    public static int factorial_iterative(int n) {
        if (n < 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        int answer = 1;
        for (int i=n;i>0;i--) {
            answer *= i;
        }
        return answer;
    }

    // recursive way
    public static int factorial_recursive(int n) {
        // base case or terminal case
        
        if (n < 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        if (n <= 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        // recursive case
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println(factorial_iterative(5));     // 120
        System.out.println(factorial_recursive(5));     // 120
    }    
}
```

# Tower of hanoi

There is a rule

```java
public class TowersOfHanoi {
    public static int hanoi(int disks, String source, String target, String spare, int step) {
        
        if (disks == 1) {
            System.out.println(String.format("Step %d: Move disk 1 from %s to %s", step, source, target));
            return step + 1;
        } else {
            step = hanoi(disks-1, source, spare, target, step);
            System.out.println(String.format("Step %d: Move disk %d from %s to %s",step, disks, source, target));
            return hanoi(disks-1, spare, target, source, step+1);
        }
        
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        hanoi(3, "A", "C", "B", 1);
    }    
}

```

Output:

```
Step 1: Move disk 1 from A to C
Step 2: Move disk 2 from A to B
Step 3: Move disk 1 from C to B
Step 4: Move disk 3 from A to C
Step 5: Move disk 1 from B to A
Step 6: Move disk 2 from B to C
Step 7: Move disk 1 from A to C
```
