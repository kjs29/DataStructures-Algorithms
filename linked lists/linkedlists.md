# LinkedList (Singly)

- Accessing: 
    
    - head: O(1)

    - other nodes: O(n) because it needs to traverse the list, which takes O(n)

- Searching for a node:

    - linear Search: O(n)

- Inserting an element (Inserting itself is O(1)):

    - inserting at the front: O(1)

    - anywhere else: O(n) because it needs to traverse the list, which takes O(n)

- Deleting an element (Deleting itself is O(1)):

    - deleting at the front: O(1)

    - anywhere else: O(n) because it needs to traverse the list, which takes O(n)
