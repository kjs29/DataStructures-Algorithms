# One example of optimizing space complexity

Let's consider the following example. 

```py
def double_it(nums):
    new_nums = [0 for _ in range(len(nums))]
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        new_nums[i] = nums[i] * 2
    return new_nums
```

We use O(n) time complexity, and also O(n) space complexity.

We can optimize space complexity of this function from O(n) to O(1).

```py
def double_it(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        nums[i] = nums[i] * 2
    return nums
```
