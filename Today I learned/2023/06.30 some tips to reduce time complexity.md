To reduce runtime of codes we can,

# Avoid nested loops

```py
for i,num in enumerate(nums):
    for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
        # code
```

Nested loops have O(n<sup>2</sup>) runtime.

If possible, use two separate for loops which have O(a+b+c...) runtime , still linear runtime.

To achieve this, we can use hashmap or set look ups, instead of another array look ups.

# Use hashmap or set look ups

```py
hashmap = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
if 9 in hashmap:
    print("found 9!")
```

Hashmap or set lookups have O(1) runtime

however, the array look ups have O(n) runtime

```py
lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
if 9 in lst:
    print("found 9!")       # O(n)
```
