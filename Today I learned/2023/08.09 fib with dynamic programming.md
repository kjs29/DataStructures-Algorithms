Normally, we would get fibonacci number like the following

```py
def fib(n):
    """
    Regular recursive fibonacci

    Time Complexity: O(2^n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n 
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
        
print(fib(5))   # 5, 0 1 1 2 3 5
```

However, `fib(10000)` would cause `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`.

If we use dynamic programming,

we take advantage of the fact that `fib(n)` uses `fib(n-2)` and `fib(n-1)`.

So, as long as we have `fib(n-2)` and `fib(n-1)` somewhere, we can come up with effective algorithm.

We can make a new array to store these numbers.

```py
previous = [0,1]
```

And imagine that we are storing `fib(2)`,

Then we need `fib(0)` and `fib(0)`,

We already know `fib(0)` is 0, `fib(1)` is 1.

Imagine that we are storing `fib(3)`

We need `fib(2)` and `fib(1)`.

But if we stored `fib(2)` in the array, we can just retrieve it with O(1) runtime.

So we can come up with array where we can store the fibonacci numbers starting from `fib(0)` to `fib(n)`.

```py
"""
if n == 2, 
previous = [0,1]
ans = previous[-2] + previous[-1]

if n == 3,
previous = [0,1,fib(2)]
ans = previous[-2] + previos[-1]

and so on.

when n == 2, we need to iterate 1 time
when n == 3, we need to iterate 2 times.

which is (n-1) times.

in each iteration, we will calculate the ans which is previous[-2] + previous[-1]
and append to previous.
"""
previous = [0,1]
for _ in range(n-1):
    ans = previous[-2] + previous[-1]
    previous.append(ans)
```

Let's look at the complete function.

```py
def fib(n):
    """
    Fib using dynamic programming

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n 
    else:
        previous = [0,1]
        for _ in range(n-1):
            ans = previous[-2] + previous[-1]
            previous.append(ans)
        return previous
```

We can continually delete the first element before appending `ans`, improving space complexity.

```py
def fib(n):
    """
    Fib using dynamic programming

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n 
    else:
        previous = [0,1]
        for _ in range(n-1):
            ans = previous[-2] + previous[-1]
        
            # delete the first element, maintaining the size of 2
            del previous[0]
            
            previous.append(ans)
        
        return previous[-1]
```

Or we can create two variables, and continually update them in each iteration.

```py
def fib(n):
    """
    Fib using dynamic programming

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    """
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return n
    else:
        prev2 = 0
        prev1 = 1
        for _ in range(n-1):
            ans = prev2 + prev1
            prev2, prev1 = prev1, ans
        return ans
```
